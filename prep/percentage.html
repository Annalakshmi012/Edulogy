      <h1>Clear Concept of Percentage</h1>
      <p>
        To do well in any test, you must understand the main elements and have a
        firm grasp on the fundamental ideas of percentage.
      </p>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          In this article, we will cover all basic concepts related to
          percentage, which is a function of mathematics. By covering each
          concept in brief, this article will help you perform great in
          quantitative aptitude and data interpretation sections of many
          competitive exams.<br /><br />
          A number or a ratio that can be expressed as a fraction of 100 is
          defined as a percentage in the field of mathematics. In order to find
          the percentage of a particular number, we simply need to divide it by
          the whole and then multiply it by 100. The official symbol of
          percentage is %.
        </p>
        <h2>Example of some percentage are</h2>
        <p>
          10 % of 200 = 10/200 X 100 = 5 <br />20% of 100 = 20/100 X 100 = 20<br /><br />
          Percentages can also be expressed using the fractional form or decimal
          form. The percentage is known to be a dimensionless number. Examples
          of decimal form percentages are 0.25%, 0.5%, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Percentage formula</h2>
        <p>
          In order to determine the value of the percentage, we simply need to
          divide the given value by the whole value and then multiply it by 100.
          So, the formula of percentage becomes: Let’s say that Y is a given
          percentage of another number, Z. <br />

          So, Y% of Z = Y/Z X 100 % <br /><br />

          Let’s take an example: <br /><br />

          Question: what is 20% of 400? <br /><br />

          Let’s assume 20% of 400 is X <br /><br />

          20/100 X 400 = x <br /><br />

          = 80 is 20% of 400.
        </p>
        <h2>Percentage change</h2>
        <p>
          2 types of changes that happen to a quantity when modifications are
          introduced are:

          <li>
            <ol>
              Change in percentage
            </ol>
            <ol>
              Change in actual value
            </ol>
          </li>
          The percentage of change can be calculated by: <br /><br />

          Actual change/ original value X 100
        </p>
        <h2>Percentage increase and decrease</h2>
        <p>
          Percentage increase: it can be calculated by subtracting the original
          number from the new and changed number and then dividing it by the
          original number X 100. <br /><br />

          Increase % = [new number – original number] / original number X 100
          <br /><br />

          Percentage decrease: it can be calculated by subtracting the new and
          changed number from the original number, further dividing it by the
          original number, and then multiplying it by 100. <br /><br />

          Decrease % = [original number – new number] / original number X 100
        </p>
        <h2>The relationship between percentage and ratio</h2>
        <p>
          If the denominator of the percentage remains constant, we can derive a
          direct relationship between the numerator of the ratio and the ratio
          itself. When the numerator is increased to a certain percentage, then
          the ratio itself is raised to a certain percentage.
        </p>
        <h2>Some percentage questions as examples</h2>
        <p>
          Question: What number would be 30% less than 120? <br /><br />

          Answer: Applying percentage formula, we get: <br /><br />

          The number we are looking for is 60% of 120 <br /><br />

          Putting them into the equation, we have <br /><br />

          60 X 120 / 100 = 72 is the required number <br /><br />

          Question: A company owner had a lot of cars to sell. They sell 20 % of
          the cars and still have 200 cars left. How many cars did the company
          owner have originally? <br /><br />

          Answer: We can suppose that the company owner had Z number of cars
          originally. <br /><br />

          According to the question, <br /><br />

          [100 – 20] % of Z = 200 <br /><br />

          Then applying the percentage formula: <br /><br />

          80 / 100 Z = 200 <br /><br />

          Z = 200 X 100 / 80 <br /><br />

          = 250 cars, the owner of the company had 250 cars originally
          <br /><br />

          There is no need to memorize the formulas related to percentages. In
          order to master problems where they ask about how to find percentages,
          you need practice and effort. Thorough knowledge of the concept of
          percentages can help you in sections such as profit loss analysis,
          compound interest, and other interest problems. In order to
          efficiently learn any concept of math, one needs to have a lot of
          practice. Practice is everything in mathematics so keep practicing
          problems on how to find percentages.<br />
